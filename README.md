# Translation: Skyrim.

A tool for translating the dragon language of Skyrim to English. Built in Python.

This is a hefty project. There is around 170 words in the dragon language, and I only have two hands. Full completion will take a lengthy amount of time.

Until complete, you can find the translator in the "staging" branch.
